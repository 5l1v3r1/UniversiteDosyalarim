          Check my new and updated components on
                          http://www.chat.ru/~hunterml/

The unit DBSEARCH.PAS includes:

        * TSearchEdit     - Simple TEdit like component that scan
                            DataSource for  user specified record.
                            As in Win help/index.

Before using this component you need to install it. To install copy
the enclosed files into a common VCL directory. In Delphi use the
Install option on the Components menu to install TSearchEdit
into your component library.

To use those component drop onto a form at design time.

If you like my components or modify it or found some bugs can you send
me some email (Hunter@hptmts.tvcom.ru). I'd just like to hear from
others around the world and I will try to reply to any email that I
receive.

Thanxxx.
